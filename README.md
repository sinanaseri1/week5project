1. Project Overview
You will build a simple application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, displaying social media posts (aka “social cards”). The site will have:

A main feed page showing multiple cards for each post.
A page with a form that lets users add a new post (username, text, optional media, likes, etc.).
A navigation bar to move between pages.
Like buttons on each post that increment the like count.
A notification/feedback mechanism when a new post is created (success or error).
